You can find the answer to take-home questions in the folder** QUESTIONS/take-home-questions** sorted into folder based on dificulty level
You can also find my self prepared questions (and answers) in a similarly structured folder **QUESTIONS/self-prepared-questions**

The rest of the files are added for my convenience so i can work cleanly with linters and typscript.
The main working file is in **src/index.ts** where i already prepared some functions that run SQL queries from the movies excersize and logs the answer to console. 

All the queries from the movies excersize can be found in **/movies**
