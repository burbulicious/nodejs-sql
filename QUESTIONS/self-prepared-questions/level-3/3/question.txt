Create a new table named "awards" to store information about awards won by movies. 
Include columns for the award name, movie title, and year. 
Then, write a script in Node.js to read data from an awards.csv
file containing award information and insert it into the newly created "awards" table. 
Ensure proper error handling and rollback in case of failures.
